support tool for my python programming class.

outline of the program:

* Display reminder to run (this) program from the parent directory of all student repos
* ask for the path of the student assignment (all students should be using the same directory structure and file name)
* ask for the name of the test file (not the one given to students to ensure testing integrity)
* run the grading
* display if there were any folders missing the assignment
* save a file with the results of the tests per student


Additional features:
* ask if you want a file copy of folders missing assignment
* create a files of all assignment paths and make a menu to choose assignment
* create a file that is a collection of student object that link grades to assignment, student names to usernames, and class period
* add testing when typing in files to make sure they exist before running grading
